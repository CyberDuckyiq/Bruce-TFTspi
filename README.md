# :shark: Bruce

Bruce is meant to be a versatile ESP32 firmware that supports a ton of offensive features focusing on facilitating Red Team operations.
It also supports m5stack products and works great with Cardputer, Sticks, M5Cores, T-Decks and T-Embeds.

# :duck: Bruce moded features
> **Moded by:** + [@alhelfi](https://github.com/alhelfi) ADD buttons and fix touch.
## ‚úÖ Features

-  Fixed touch for TFT SPI 
    The inverted touch issue on the 2.4 and 2.8 TFT SPI displays has been resolved. Previously, the touch was inverted, meaning that when you pressed the right, you pressed the left, and vice versa.
-  buttons for TFT SPI 
    Run Bruce with buttons on a TFT
    Note: When boot the device on a 2.4 TFT display, the colors are reversed. Go to Settings, then turn on the colors, and cancel Dim Time.

## üìù Notes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't add all modules together .
> 
>  ‚ö†Ô∏è When boot the device on a 2.4 TFT display with buttons, the colors are reversed. Go to Settings, then turn on the colors, and cancel Dim Time. .
